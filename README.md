**USA Baseball NTIS Try-Out Location Web Map**
In this web map, I created an application where users can view all the locations for tryouts in their region at once. By clicking on their region, they are brought to that area on the map where the specific region's website (hosted by leagueapps) and contact information is made available in the BootStrap Column to the left of the map. BootStrap and Leaflet were the most vital libraries used in this map, where the location and date data for try-outs were displayed directly on the map. Additionally, the navigation bar at the top of the map holds the title and original webpage ([https://www.usabaseball.com/events/national-team-identification-series/about])​​ the web map's information is found. Though this data is all retroactively sourced from the 2023 season, a similar tool can be created to be utilized for the 2024 season. Some additional features I would look to add later include pages where months are included to display tryouts during select dates rather than just all locations and all dates. Additionally, a pop up "about" window would be highly useful rather than the short few sentences available for the user.
